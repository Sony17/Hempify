        <h1>Hempify Planet: Our mission</h1>
       
        <p>Global warming as a result of climate change has become a
           major concern for people all over the world. It has recently 
           drawn the attention of the entire conscious community, 
           with the fear that if not addressed properly,
            it will result in the
             <strong>extinction of numerous species around the world.</strong> 
             At the same time, it will pose a threat to human health, food security,
             living environment and standard of living. 
             Thereby, possible solutions are being explored accordingly; 
             regulations have been imposed in places binding green production practices, 
             limiting the emission of CO2 and emphasis is given on renewable resources along with the search for 
             alternatives to carbon-positive materials. Cannabis sativa L. (hemp) has received a 
             lot of attention because of its multipurpose usability, short production cycle, low capital demand in cultivation, 
             possibility of carbon-negative transformation and easy carbon sequestering material.
              <strong>hemp as a very promising renewable resource including its potential uses in paper, textiles, composites, biofuel, and food industry.</strong> </p>

           <em>Hemp, also known as industrial hemp, can be seen by some people as a controversial plant, but it doesnâ€™t need to be.</em>
           The hemp plant is a variety of Cannabis sativa that has been cultivated for its fiber, not any psychoactive effects. Many strains of hemp have none of the mental effects associated with cannabis. This type of industrial hemp has been used as a fiber source, for oil, and as an important source of nutrition for thousands of years.
